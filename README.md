# 1 What is this?

Welcome!

This is a public knowledge base and notes repository for researching, developing, studying, and experimenting for everything deltatraced!

Other repositories in the organization give deliverables. This gives the behind-the-scenes, and also some reader-facing articles may surface still!

For higher browser viewing compatibility, switch to the [webview branch](https://github.com/deltatraced/delta-trace/tree/webview).

All contributions are welcome!

If you have any comments or suggestions you can reach out by opening an issue ticket or emailing lanhikarixx@gmail.com.

If you find any issues on matters of performance, ergonomics, security, accuracy, practice, or related, please reach out!

One reason for making notes public is to make my creative process transparent and open to review by others to help me keep improving my process!
