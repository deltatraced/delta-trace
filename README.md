# 1 What is this?

Welcome!

This is the central notes repository for everything delta-domain-rnd! 

Other repositories in the organization give deliverables. This gives the behind-the-scenes, and also some reader-facing articles may surface still!

For higher browser viewing compatibility, switch to the [webview branch](https://github.com/delta-domain-rnd/delta-trace/tree/webview).
