# 1 Vscode Rust Local project config

# 2 Objective

I would like to have a local file holding my `#cfg(feature = "xxx")` stuff. I don't want to keep writing this to my global config just so rust-analyzer detects it.
# 3 Solution

create in the repo `.vscode/settings.json`

Add the following to it:
```json
{
  "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
    "xxx"
  ],
}
```

You may need to do Ctrl+Shift+P and `Developer: Reload Window` in vscode
