# 1 Goal

We need to get some foundational ground for the project.

We need a basic prototype website implementation that can source obsidian content.

Our test case will be sourcing a page per deployment marked issues and HowTos in an obsidian vault.

# 2 Objectives

**Deployment**

* [x] We need to to be able to publish content online and the links should be professional.
  * [x] [000 Get a domain name to publish in for self-hosting](../../tasks/000%20Get%20a%20domain%20name%20to%20publish%20in%20for%20self-hosting.md)

**Design**

* [ ] Create Figma mockups of the intended pages' UI design

**Documentation**

* [ ] A limited first draft of the sourcing standard is written.

**Development**

* [ ] Develop the website skeleton where content could be filled in and layouts are developed

* [ ] Obsidian markdown content should be parsed to fill in content in the static website
