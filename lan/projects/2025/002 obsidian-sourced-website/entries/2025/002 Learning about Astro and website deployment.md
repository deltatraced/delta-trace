Looking at [wasmer templates](https://wasmer.io/templates). Their [static website template](https://wasmer.io/templates/static-website) is probably the simplest example there is. Their [tutorial (broken)](https://docs.wasmer.io/edge/tutorials/cdn) for it is a broken link.

Ok looking at the [static website repo](https://github.com/static-web-server/static-web-server) it seems not simple, it's using Rust and many things. Need just basic HTML + CSS + JS hosting.

Let's create a reference and see if we can deploy it. [[001 Create a reference basic website and host it with wasmer]].

There's also a [simple python server on wasmer](https://wasmer.io/templates/python-http-server).

Can also get an idea from [frontend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)

Interestingly it has React > Astro for server side rendering (SSR).

This one is the [backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) and a [fullstack roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack).
