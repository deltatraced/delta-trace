## 3.1 Purchasing a Domain Name

- [x] 

2025-08-12 Wk 33 Tue - 18:12

Since this repository is `delta-trace`, let's get a `deltatraced.com` domain name! It's traced since a lot of the content there will be sourced from obsidian vaults like this! Also because `deltatrace.com` is taken of course.

A comparison of costs from different domain name brokers as of this writing,

| Domain Name     | Registrar                                                                                                | Cost (USD) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| deltatraced.com | [hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/domain-name-results?domain=deltatraced&from=domain-name-search)    | 2.99       |
| deltatraced.com | [freehosting](https://www.freehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&domain=register)                         | 18.99      |
| deltatraced.com | [cloudflare](https://domains.cloudflare.com/?domain=deltatraced.com)                                     | 10.44      |
| deltatraced.com | [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=deltatraced.com)              | 11.28      |
| deltatraced.io  | [hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/domain-name-results?domain=deltatraced.io&from=domain-name-search) | 31.99      |
| deltatraced.io  | [freehosting](https://www.freehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&domain=register)                         | 89.29      |
| deltatraced.io  | [cloudflare](https://domains.cloudflare.com/?domain=deltatraced.io)                                      | 45.00      |
| deltatraced.io  | [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=deltatraced.io)               | 34.98      |

Once purchased and we have an IPv4 to host over, we will need to assign an A record to the purchased domain name. 

We should also have an email for this. We could set up our own mail exchange, but this is low priority for now.

[freehosting.com](https://freehosting.com/) seems to allow a free option where we can pick our own domain name too.

They also allow [purchasing of domains names](https://www.freehosting.com/client/cart.php?a=add&domain=register).

This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1i0av3m/whats_the_best_free_hosting_site_for_a_basic_site/) recommends different possible free hosting services,

[Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) ([Github pages guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)), [wordpress.com](wordpress.com), [wasmer](https://wasmer.io/free-web-hosting),

[wasmer](https://wasmer.io/free-web-hosting) supports hosting directly from github which is interesting.

So far we have [freehosting](https://www.freehosting.com/), [hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/domain-name-results), 

See some cost comparisons for a sample domain name in [[#3.1 Purchasing a Domain Name]].
