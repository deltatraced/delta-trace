This explains a little about using an RC filter to turn a PWM signal into analog

I found this entry:

I modeled a way to vary the percentage of how on or off a line is by changing a parameter a from 0 to 1: [desmos simulation 1](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/x5spbh3ar2).

This is called pulse width modulation in electronics.

Then, instead of giving each pulse the same width or percentage_on, I also modeled a way to translate another signal like a sin wave into different pulse widths. If you change parameters `b` and `c` and notice one red dot, you see that it corresponds to the pulse width above it, translating energy change in space to the length of time a wire is active essentially [desmos simulation 2](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2upmz8gsp4).

I also kept the blue constant pulse width signal a little above it for reference

This is the pattern these red dots lie in at every pulse:  [desmos simulation 3](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dpzwieksjr).

All this is because I've a little computer that can only output full power or nothing, and yet I want it to play music with a little cheap magnet speaker I salvaged with my siblings from some of their old toys. But full on full off doesn't play much. But if I vary the time it's on and off like this, I could charge a capacitor like a little battery just right when the pulse is active or discharge it when the pulse is inactive so that I can play a musical note

Desmos is really cool that I can share models where people vary parameters to play around with them

[Transistor 2N3906 (PNP)](https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/2n3906-d.pdf).

For a PNP transistor to conduct, Vb < Ve - 0.7V usually.

Facing the square side, Left to right: Emitter, Base, Collector

The symbol has an arrow on the emitter down pointing *towards* the base. This means PNP. If it was pointing *away*, it would be NPN. For PNP, current flows from emitter to collector, as indicated by the arrow on the emitter towards the base.

To satisfy the condition Vb < Ve - 0.7V, we connect Ve to VCC. This lets it conduct on Vb=0 -> 0 < VCC - 0.7V and not conduct on Vb=VCC -> VCC </< VCC - 0.7V 

Judging by the amplitude of the output sound, I seem to get a louder signal. However, it is strange that VCC also outputs sound (and a kind of sinusoid), which might mean that this system ground is not attenuating the cap current.
