# 1 Objective

To get this project building again and to add docker instructions for all tools necessary to build and run it.

Ideally the user should only connect the board to their PC via the macro USB cable and follow instructions on the schematic wiring, and they should be able to program it.

First we need to recover any notes on how we built and setup this project, or look up in the documentation how to get it building again. Note I've done this in Windows before, but now my PC is on Linux, and ultimately we want this to work under docker. See [task](000%20Get%20teensy2%20embedded%20system%20to%20work%20again%20under%20docker.md#31-find-out-build-and-running-information). <a name="spawn-task-find-build-info" />^spawn-task-find-build-info

There's also a test circuit on the breadboard of this already. Let's recover what this was. See [task](000%20Get%20teensy2%20embedded%20system%20to%20work%20again%20under%20docker.md#32-document-already-configured-test-keyboard-circuit). <a name="spawn-task-doc-config-keybd-circuit" />^spawn-task-doc-config-keybd-circuit
