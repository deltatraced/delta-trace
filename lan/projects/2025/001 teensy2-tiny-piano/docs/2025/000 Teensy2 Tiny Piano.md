The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/delta-domain-rnd/teensy2-tiny-piano).

This is a project to experiment with circuits and embedded systems. It uses an old miroconcotroller, the teensy2

You can see hardware information about teensy 2 [here](https://github.com/LanHikari22/lan-setup-notes/blob/main/lan/topics/hardware/entries/000%20Listing%20some%20peripherals%20and%20embedded%20devices%20I%20own.md#221-teensy-2).

The goal is to create a functional tiny piano, like the ones sold for children's toys.
