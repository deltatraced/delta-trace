# 1 Goal

Given a `dbmt` schema file, we need to generate a Rust library which integrates that database information into the rust type system and utilize Rust's type system for correctness in library use.

By the end of this goal, we will have a deliverable containing a...

1.  [ ] specification document for `dbmt`, a superset language of [`dbml`](https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs/). ^deliver1
2.  [ ] functional reader and writer for the `dbmt` language ^deliver2
3.  [ ] `dbmint` CLI that takes a `dbmt` schema file and creates a Rust library in specified mount location accordingly. ^deliver3
4.  [ ] Rust library generated via `dbmt` schema file allowing...
	1.  [ ] type-correct selections, queries, inserts, updates, deletions, and basic star joins ^deliver4-1
	2.  [ ] db verification including at the granular level (per column, per table) and the generic level (per type). Those should be routed in the `dbmt` schema file, and implemented either in the library for built-in commands or by the library user via library signals. They can distinguish different events such as writing, reading, deleting, inserting, init, etc. ^deliver4-2
	3. [ ] Data access hygiene with tables marked Fixed, Immutable, Mutable, or Ephemeral. These correspond to operations (Read, Read/Insert, Read/Insert/Update, Read/Insert/Update/Delete). This option may be bypassed when generating an admin use library. ^deliver4-3
	4. [ ] auto-computed fields on events like creation (example: date of creation), and writing (example: last update date). ^deliver4-4
	5. [ ] virtual read-only fields that do not exist really in the database but act as if they do and are computed on fetch. ^deliver4-5
5. [ ] Extended visualization tools from `dbml` for `dbmt` including standalone nodejs rendering and vscode extension. ^deliver5
6. [ ] Basic database editing workflow solution that allow (1) a logical order of inserting new table entries, and (2) a custom table for insertion and editing purposes that corresponds to the schema details. ^deliver6
7. [ ] Tests proving that the generated rust library...
	1. [ ] Works at scale with respect to number of columns in tables ^deliver7-1
	2. [ ] Works at scale with respect to the number of tables in a database ^deliver7-2
	3. [ ] Works at scale with respect to the number of defined table joins ^deliver7-3
	4. [ ] Provides efficient database operations proven by measurements ^deliver7-4
