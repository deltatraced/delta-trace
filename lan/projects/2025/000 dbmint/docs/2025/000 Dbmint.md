# 1 About

You can find the project github page [here](https://github.com/LanHikari22/dbmint).

dbmint is a tooling project for working with sqlite3 databases. It integrates database generation with visualization using the `dbmt` language which is a derivative of the [`dbml`](https://dbdiagram.io/) language for schema specification.

One aim with dbmint is to empower creators to create and operate databases in an intuitive and visual way.
