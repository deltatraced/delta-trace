# 1 Problem

This project started out of a need to integrate many different pieces of time and task information. I wanted to have a visual web calendar, but I did not want to have to populate it manually. I wanted to have a time logger, but I wanted I wanted to take into consideration the structure of my tasks.

On top of that, whenever I move machines, many of my productivity tools have to be reinstalled. Since time management is very central, I wanted to be as easy as possible to spawn a server to do these management tasks.

Over time, the requirements grew. My work became more interconnected. I wanted to integrate notes with tasks and not have to jump back and forth between those views. Tasks could reference any other task. References themselves could be internal or external, and all of this should be searchable. Tasks may have time reports, or they may have expectations.

# 2 Experience

Before this project, my note taking had been spread across text files, and often it would take a while to generate a report out of it or analyze it for introspection.

As I began developing and using TTM in Dematic and afterwards, my note taking style had a lot of growth. I picked a log-style type of note taking where I keep writing what is at the edge of my attention, and organize my thoughts in real time onto my notes.

# 3 Next Steps

I have moved my note taking to Obsidian and markdown. While taking notes in the terminal is powerful, Obsidian allows me to have multimedia features such as images and sketched all integrated together. But I aim to replicate the strong aspects of TTM here in obsidian. My note taking methodology started with TTM, and with obsidian I have decided to make many of my open source notes public.
