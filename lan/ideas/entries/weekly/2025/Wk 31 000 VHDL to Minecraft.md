# 1 Idea

I've had this idea for a while, but let's make it a little more concrete.

Here are courses [CE1901](https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/meier/ce1901/lectures.html) and [CE1921](https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/meier/ce1921/labs.html) by [Dr. Meier](https://faculty-web.msoe.edu/meier/) on Digital logic and computer architecture.

I'd like to go through these labs again and make them easy to run and build.

But for the purposes of this idea, wouldn't it be cool to synthesize all this digital logic, culminating with a single-cycle processor in minecraft red stone?

Then you will really have to understand how languages like VHDL synthesize logic, since you have to synthesize them yourself to redstone logic!

Then we could do the content of this course, but on a minecraft environment which would be accessible to everyone who doesn't have the electronics or who wants to interact with those systems beyond Quartus simulation views.
