Capture my thoughts on a direction for math studying and look for some resources.

## 2.1 Some initial thoughts and resources

2025-07-27 Wk 30 Sun - 12:38

Some broad directions.

1.  I would like to eventually reach towards studying type theory like with the [HoTT book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) and [Martin-Lof works](https://github.com/michaelt/martin-lof).

[Intuitionistic Type Theory Per Martin-Lof](https://archive-pml.github.io/martin-lof/pdfs/Bibliopolis-Book-retypeset-1984.pdf).

There are some type theory learning resources [here](https://github.com/jozefg/learn-tt?tab=readme-ov-file).

2. Learning statistical machine learning and implementing neural network algorithms and other data science algorithms.

Some resources for type theory

[type theory presentation](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/assets/documents/type-theory.pdf) by [Chase Meadors](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/research/).

[Syntax and Semantics](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/assets/documents/syntax-semantics.pdf) by [Chase Meadors](https://math.colorado.edu/~chme3268/research/).

[gh cemulate/the-mlab](https://github.com/cemulate/the-mlab?tab=readme-ov-file). This seems to be nlab but less formal to be easier to get into?


Some bullet overview and resources like books or conferences by [Michael Kirchner](https://kirchner.io/compendium/type-theory#mathematics).

[15-819 Homotopy Type Theory Course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/courses/hott/) (recommended by this [post](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2438477)).

## 2.2 Finding recommendations on prereqs for type theory

2025-07-27 Wk 30 Sun - 14:08

Some areas to learn about may include Group Theory and Category Theory

[this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/nnpl0s/comment/gzx93si/) comments that studying algebraic topology motivates category theory.

They also recommend nLab there.

Also affirmed by this [mathovervflow answer](https://mathoverflow.net/a/389193) which lists also other book recommendations that use category theory on Algebra, Functional Analysis, Elementary set theory, etc. Some include:
- [Paolo Aluffi. _Algebra. Chapter 0](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Chapter-0-Paolo-Aluffi/dp/147046571X).
	- Also has [Algebra Notes from the Underground](https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Notes-Underground-Paolo-Aluffi/dp/1108958230)
- [Algebraic Topology by Tammo tom Dieck](https://www.amazon.com/Algebraic-Topology-Ems-Textbooks-Mathematics/dp/3037190485)
- [Alexander Helemskii. Lectures and Exercises on Functional Analysis](https://bookstore.ams.org/mmono-233/)
