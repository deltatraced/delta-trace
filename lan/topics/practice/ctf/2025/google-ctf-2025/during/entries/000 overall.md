    We are now at the 24-hour mark: all challenges were released, and we have decided we will not be releasing any more. GLHF!
- #### メガ update
    
    17:10 Jun 28 2025
    
    To make the メガ challenges less annoying for those who already solved it locally, the ability to get the flag from the server may depend on mame version you installed. This wasn't obvious and we apologise. The version we run at the server is 0.277+dfsg.1-0ubuntu1~ppa3~noble1 and it comes from ppa:c.falco/mame. This note has been added to the challenge description too.

We got somewhere I guess with Multiarch. We still need to understand how the file is being interpreted.

Anyway, let's try to get all of the puzzle attachments.
