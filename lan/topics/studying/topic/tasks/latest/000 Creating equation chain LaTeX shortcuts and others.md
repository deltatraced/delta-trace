# 1 Objective

I used to write math in vscode. I came up with a system for equational reasoning using LaTeX.  It allowed steps and annotations/comments. I would like to replicate some of this here.

Maybe we would approach it differently by having many LaTeX blocks instead with the step-no/annotations being just in markdown. 

but we also had custom math functions and symbols and that could be good to replicate too, like some LaTeX file to load here.
