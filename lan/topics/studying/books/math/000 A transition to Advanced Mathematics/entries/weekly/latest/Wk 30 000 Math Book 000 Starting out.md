I guess for some set $A = \lbrace a_1, a_2, a_3 \rbrace$, we would say $a_1$ element-of A, or $a_1 \in A$ .

When I was looking into some constructive math stuff, I was also thinking in terms of `of-type` rather than `element-of`, since types detail how data is interpreted rather than being really a set.

I would write

to say $a_1$ is `of-type` A. 

When I figure out including LaTeX stuff here I'd bring it back as `\oft`...

I'm pretty sure I've talked with someone before who disagreed with this convention and said that I may be more referring to the programmatic set as having these constraints. They said that a set in mathematics is the most basic notion, and only includes restrictions like no repetition if you specify so. But here they do mean that normal notion of set.

so $\lbrace 2x : x \in Z \rbrace$ reads "The set of the form 2x such-that x is-in Z".

subset-of relation!

They have interesting convention for specifying inputs to a problem. `Fix "inputs". Problem query"`. I guess I usually see Given {inputs}, query.

Hmm. I figured they would use $A \subset B$ but then again, subset-or-include is built off of this.
