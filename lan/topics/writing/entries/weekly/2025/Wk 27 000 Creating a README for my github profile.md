Cloning it into my system

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src/cloned/gh/LanHikari22
cd ~/src/cloned/gh/LanHikari22
git clone git@github.com:LanHikari22/LanHikari22.git
cd LanHikari22
```

They have some suggestions:

<!--
**LanHikari22/LanHikari22** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...

We also should change this description. It's been there a while:

> A Computer Engineer! Into software engineering, reverse engineering, embedded systems, and FPGAs. Looking to solve hard problems.

Changed to

> Computer engineer interested in reproducibility of knowledge and computer systems, reverse engineering, data analysis, and tooling.
