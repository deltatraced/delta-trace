# 1 What is this?

The `topics/concept` topic is to index concepts, definitions, etc. that I encounter and to refer to the concept note of them in other places.

They're meant to be minimal but sufficient in explanation, while entries elsewhere may explore intuitions around them or practical applications. They also describe relation to other concepts.

Generally, Concept notes will not refer to non-conceptual notes. But non-conceptual notes can refer to them. If a note serves the purpose of clarifying the concept (such as creating an interactive simulation to explore it) it may be referenced.

Concept notes may refer to external file resources. For example, an `idris2` implementation of a proof described in mathematical language.

Concept notes may refer to external educational resources on the topic in the resources section.

Tags will be used to situate the concept context. Otherwise, there will be broad categories like definitions and proofs for mathematics.
