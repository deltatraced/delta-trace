## 1.1 Lan, inductive definition with sets

(1)

Let there be a [[001 Set|set]], call that set `Nat`. 

(2)

`1` is an element of set `Nat`.

(3)

For each element `n` in `Nat`, there exists an element `succ(n)` representing the successor of `n`.

$$ \forall n \in \text{Nat}: \exists \ \text{succ}(n) $$


This forms an infinite set of the form

$$
\text{Nat} \equiv \lbrace 1,\  \text{succ}(1),\ \text{succ}(\text{succ}(1)),\ \dots) \rbrace
$$
