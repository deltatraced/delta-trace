A [set](001%20Set.md) $A$ is said to be countable, if there can exist a function $f : A \to \mathbb{N}$  that is [injective](012%20injective.md) (distinct elements of $A$ map to distinct elements of $\mathbb{N}$).

This also means that its size needs to be smaller or equal to the size of the set of [natural numbers](000%20Nat.md).
