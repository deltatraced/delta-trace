A bijection is a function that describes one-to-one correspondence of [sets](001%20Set.md).

A function that is both [injective](012%20injective.md) and [surjective](013%20surjective.md) is bijective. Injective gives us one-to-one from the domain to the range, and surjective gives us closure of the range unto the domain.

In other words, we know there are distinct element mappings (injective), and we know that the range is fully covered (surjective), so we know that there is full one-to-one correspondence.

A bijective function $f$ also always has an inverse function $g$ such that $f(g) = I$ where $I$ is the identity function.
