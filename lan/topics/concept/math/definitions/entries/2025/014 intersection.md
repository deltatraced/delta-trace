A [set](001%20Set.md) $A \cap B$  is an intersection of sets $A$ and $B$.

It is defined through [set builder notation](009%20Set%20builder%20notation.md) as follows:

$$

A \cap B \equiv \lbrace x \in U \suchthat  x \in A \land x \in B \rbrace

$$

You can read this as "A intersect B is equivalent to the set of all elements $x$ in the [universe](006%20compliment.md#term-universe) such that $x$ is in $A$ and $x$ is in $B$."
