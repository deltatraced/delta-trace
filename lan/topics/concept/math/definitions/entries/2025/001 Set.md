A container with elements in it. A foundational mathematical object. Many objects are defined in terms of it, like the set of natural numbers.

# 1 Definition

## 1.1 Lan, Informal

A set is a mathematical object that [contains](021%20Collection.md) elements in it. They may define properties or operations that can be done on them.

For example,

$$ A = \lbrace a, b, c \rbrace $$

is a set `A` with the elements `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Sets are unordered. They also have unique elements.

They are foundational for defining our mathematical objects. For example there are sets like the natural numbers, the rational numbers, and the real numbers. There are finite sets, and infinite sets.
