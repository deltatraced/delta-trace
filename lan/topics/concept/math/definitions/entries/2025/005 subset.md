## 1.1 Wiki definition

A [set](001%20Set.md) $A$ is said to be a subset of another set $B$ if all elements of $A$ are elements of $B$. Then we also say that $B$ is a superset of $A$.

We use the symbol $\subseteq$ to denote subset. $A \subseteq B$ means that A is a subset of B.

$A \subseteq B \equiv \forall x (x \in A \implies x \in B)$  which is read as "A proper subset-of B is equivalent to for all x, x in A implies x in B"

Note that $A \subseteq B$ implies that $A \subset B$ or $A = B$.  $A \subset B$ means A is a proper subset of B.
