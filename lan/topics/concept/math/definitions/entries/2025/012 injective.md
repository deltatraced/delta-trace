See the wiki: [Injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function)

$x \hookrightarrow f(x)$ indicates that $x$ is injective on $f(x)$, or we say that $f$ is an injective function.

Distinct elements of $x$ map to distinct elements of $f(x)$. So for two values $x_1 \ne x2$, then $f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)$.

Shows that even though there's an injective function from $X$ to $Y$, it still is possible that the set $Y$ to have a larger size than $X$.

This [tex stackexchange comment](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/618936/what-is-a-reasonable-way-to-represent-a-bijective-mapping#comment1545545_618936) mentions that `\hookrightarrow` ($\hookrightarrow$) is used for injective. They hint at a two headed version for surjective, which could be like `\twoheadrightarrow` ($\twoheadrightarrow$).
