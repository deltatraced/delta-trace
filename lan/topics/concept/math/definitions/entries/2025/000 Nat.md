## 1.1 Lan, inductive definition with sets

(1)

Let there be a [set](001%20Set.md), call that set `Nat`.

(2)

`1` is an element of set `Nat`.

(3)

For each element `n` in `Nat`, there exists an element `succ(n)` representing the successor of `n`.

$$ \forall n \in \text{Nat}: \exists \ \text{succ}(n) $$

This forms an infinite set of the form

$$
\text{Nat} \equiv \lbrace 1,\  \text{succ}(1),\ \text{succ}(\text{succ}(1)),\ \dots) \rbrace
$$

## 1.2 nLab, Type

Defined in [nlab](https://github.com/ncatlab/nlab-content/blob/dff071804718922fdd4052148e33652b7760010c/pages/5/6/9/8/8965/content.md?plain=1#L158) as follows:

````
Inductive nat : Type :=
 | zero : nat
 | succ : nat -> nat.
