A Universe $U$ is said to be the [set](001%20Set.md) of all elements under consideration. <a name="term-universe" />^term-universe

The compliment of a set $A$ is written as $A^c$ and is defined as

$$

A^c \equiv U \text{ \\ } A \equiv \forall x(x \in U: x \notin A)

$$

You can read this as "compliment-of $A$ is equivalent to $U$ minus $A$ which is equivalent to for all x such that x is in $U$ and x is not in $A$"

$U \text{ \\ } A$  is also called the absolute compliment of $A$. A relative compliment would find a difference of A in a set other than $U$.

Note that $U$ is informally defined here. Consideration needs to be taken to avoid russel's paradox. You can learn about it here: [wiki Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox).
