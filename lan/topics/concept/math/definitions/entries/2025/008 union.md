See the wiki: [Union (set theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)).

A [set](001%20Set.md) $A \cup B$ is said to be a union of $A$ and $B$ and is defined in [set builder notation](009%20Set%20builder%20notation.md) as

$$

A \cup B \equiv \lbrace a \in U \suchthat a \in A \lor a \in B \rbrace

$$

which can be read as "$A$ union $B$ is equivalent to the set of all $a$ in the [universe](006%20compliment.md#term-universe) such that $a$ is in $A$ or $a$ is in $B$."
