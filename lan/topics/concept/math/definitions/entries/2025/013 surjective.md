A bijection is a function that describes one-to-one correspondence of [sets](001%20Set.md).

A function $f: X \twoheadrightarrow Y$  is said to be surjective. That is, every element of $Y$ maps onto an element of $X$. There is no requirement of uniqueness, so the same value $y \in Y$ may be mapped to by multiple values $x \in X$.
