Agent and language control over SpaceChem in Linux Ubuntu GNOME

Games like SpaceChem can be programmed from the UI based on how the devs intended it to be played. It would be useful to extend this using so that they could be played via strategies developed in Rust. This would enable further experiments with developing AI environments to solve these games or experimenting with language designs that synthesize into SpaceChem solutions. 

The main hurdle here is to create a general framework to hook onto the game UI. Think like Selenium does for the browser.

# Tools
Some brainstorming and diagnostics will be done alongside a large language model: gemma3:27b-it-qat over ollama.
