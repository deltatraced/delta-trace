Join the 16-bit revolution! Can you help Sonk the Rabbit find all flags? Submit your recording to get the flag: python3 submit.py solution.inp [mega.2025.ctfcompetition.com](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http%3A%2F%2Fmega.2025.ctfcompetition.com) 1337 Note: Submit the flag starting with "CTF{A:" here. For submitting the other flag, see the challenge titled "メガB". Note 2: To make the メガ challenges less annoying for those who already solved it locally, the ability to get the flag from the server may depend on mame version you installed. This wasn't obvious and we apologise. The version we run at the server is 0.277+dfsg.1-0ubuntu1~ppa3~noble1 and it comes from ppa:c.falco/mame.
